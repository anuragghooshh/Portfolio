                    <h1>AI generating Images, is WHOLESOME indeed, But...</h1>

                    <div>
                        <p>Well, This thing "Specifically" is in everyones mouth and it is quite obvious!
                            Who'd have thought that "ANY" image can be generated with just a combination of few words
                            or better call it a "Prompt".<br><br> Unfortunately, There are also few disbeliefs that I believe I've
                            heard and they make 0 sense!<br>
                            One of them says <i>"It is the end of Graphic Designers."</i><br>
                            Well, There will always exist two words "<i>Custom</i>" & "<i>Accurate.</i>"
                            <br><br>Let me state few snags in the process against the given statement to make things understandable.
                        </p>

                                <h4>Can't spell properly</h4>
                                <p>Well the AI is new and still learning but <b>for now</b> let's keep that aside,
                                    Dall•e 2 suffers in spelling words correctly!<br>Ofcourse you won't be craving for
                                    mis-spelled words for your Business. Will you?
                                </p>

                                <h4>Not Pixel Perfect(Superficial)</h4>
                                <p>Not getting it? Look at these pictures,Few of them have their edges low-poly, Somewhere the typography is dull, Some of them looks like
                                    that they are painted with acrylic colors or are grainy.
                                    <br>Well it will be of tremendous help if used as references , website images or concept arts, BUT as the main thing? Don't think of it.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Understanding of language is very sketchy</h4>
                                <p>Gary Marcus, scientist and the author of Rebooting AI, said: “DALL-E is probably best used as a source of inspiration rather than a tool for final products.<br>
                                    You can say something like “a boat on the sea, in a Van Gogh style”, and get something beautiful.<br>
                                    But if you want to change the end product, perhaps to “a boat on the sea but with five people rather than 4,
                                     with the tallest person in the front and the shorter person in the back, with the same boat, but painted brown, and a slightly darker background”, 
                                     the system probably won't understand the language well enough to meet your exact specifications.”
                                </p> 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Limited extensions</h4>
                                <p>Doesn't provide <b>.svg</b> files which are best suited for the Web and further graphical tweaks.
                                </p>
